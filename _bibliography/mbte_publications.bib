      abstract={Lichens are complex symbiotic systems where fungi interact with an extracellular arrangement of one or more photosynthetic partners and an indeterminate number of other microbes. Recently, specific lichen–microbial community associations have been proposed. In this study, we aimed to characterize the differences in bacteria associated with closely related lichens, under a defined set of environmental conditions in Colombian paramos. Our goal was to determine if there is a correlation between microbiota and host divergence in lichen species belonging to the genus Sticta. We found that specific microbiota are defined by their mycobiont at the genus level. Further, distinct bacterial families show differences among the three studied genera, and specific amplicon sequence variants further discriminate among lichen species within each genus. A geographic component also determines the composition of these microbial communities among lichen species. Our functional analysis revealed that fungal partners play a key role in synthesizing complex polysaccharides, while bacterial-derived antioxidants and photoprotective mechanisms contribute to desiccation tolerance in lichens. These insights highlight the complex interactions within lichen symbioses that could be relevant in environments such as the paramo ecosystem.},

      author={David Langenberger and Clara Bermudez-Santana and Jana Hertel and Steve Hoffmann and Philipp Khaitovich and Peter F. Stadler},
      abstract={MicroRNA-offset-RNAs (moRNAs) were recently detected as highly abundant class of small RNAs in a basal chordate. Using short read sequencing data, we show here that moRNAs are also produced from human microRNA precursors, albeit at quite low expression levels. The expression levels of moRNAs are unrelated to those of the associated microRNAs. Surprisingly, microRNA precursors that also show moRNAs are typically evolutionarily old, comprising more than half of the microRNA families that were present in early Bilateria, while evidence for moRNAs was found only for a relative small fraction of microRNA families of recent origin.},

      abstract={The genus Amanita encompasses both symbiotic, ectomycorrhizal fungi and asymbiotic litter decomposers; all species are derived from asymbiotic ancestors. Symbiotic species are no longer able to degrade plant cell walls. The carbohydrate esterases family 1 (CE1s) is a diverse group of enzymes involved in carbon metabolism, including decomposition and carbon storage. CE1 genes of the ectomycorrhizal A. muscaria appear diverged from all other fungal homologues, and more similar to CE1s of bacteria, suggesting a horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event.},

      journal = {Oxford Academic},
      author={Jaqueline Hess and Inger Skrede and Maryam Chaib De Mares and Matthieu Hainaut and Bernard Henrissat and Anne Pringle},
      abstract={Fungi are evolutionary shape shifters and adapt quickly to new environments. Ectomycorrhizal (EM) symbioses are mutualistic associations between fungi and plants and have evolved repeatedly and independently across the fungal tree of life, suggesting lineages frequently reconfigure genome content to take advantage of open ecological niches. To date analyses of genomic mechanisms facilitating EM symbioses have involved comparisons of distantly related species, but here, we use the genomes of three EM and two asymbiotic (AS) fungi from the genus Amanita as well as an AS outgroup to study genome evolution following a single origin of symbiosis. Our aim was to identify the defining features of EM genomes, but our analyses suggest no clear differentiation of genome size, gene repertoire size, or transposable element content between EM and AS species. Phylogenetic inference of gene gains and losses suggests the transition to symbiosis was dominated by the loss of plant cell wall decomposition genes, a confirmation of previous findings. However, the same dynamic defines the AS species A. inopinata, suggesting loss is not strictly associated with origin of symbiosis. Gene expansions in the common ancestor of EM Amanita were modest, but lineage specific and large gene family expansions are found in two of the three EM extant species. Even closely related EM genomes appear to share few common features. The genetic toolkit required for symbiosis appears already encoded in the genomes of saprotrophic species, and this dynamic may explain the pervasive, recurrent evolution of ectomycorrhizal associations},

      author={Ruth Hernández and Maryam Chaib De Mares and Hugo Jimenez and Alejandro Reyes and Alejandro Caro-Quintero},
      abstract={Cattle productivity depends on our ability to fully understand and manipulate the fermentation process of plant material that occurs in the bovine rumen, which ultimately leads to the improvement of animal health and increased productivity with a reduction in environmental impact. An essential step in this direction is the phylogenetic and functional characterization of the microbial species composing the ruminal microbiota. To address this challenge, we separated a ruminal fluid sample by size and density using a sucrose density gradient. We used the full sample and the smallest fraction (5%), allowing the enrichment of bacteria, to assemble metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). We obtained a total of 16 bacterial genomes, 15 of these enriched in the smallest fraction of the gradient. According to the recently proposed Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) taxonomy, these MAGs belong to Bacteroidota, Firmicutes_A, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Spirochaetota phyla},
